# Internationalized S/MIME
Experimentation and musings on using S/MIME with internationalized email addresses

## Introduction
Are you one of the few people in the world (relatively speaking) with a non-ASCII email address (say `François.Noël@example.com`) and have been thinking about protecting your email with S/MIME? Maybe you should think again. It is _theoretically_ possible, but in practice it is like putting a camel through the eye of a needle (Luke 18:25) - your chances are very slim, so you should leave it alone, at least as of Dec 2024.
